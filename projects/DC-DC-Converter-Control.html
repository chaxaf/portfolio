      <h1>Analysis and Control of SAB and PSFB Converters</h1>
      <p class="section-intro">
        Semester project at EPFL’s Power Electronics Laboratory where I designed and tuned
        control strategies for high-power Single Active Bridge (SAB) and Phase-Shifted Full
        Bridge (PSFB) DC/DC converters intended for medium-voltage DC grids fed by renewable
        sources. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Large-scale integration of renewables requires isolated, efficient DC/DC conversion
            between a 5&nbsp;kV input and a 20&nbsp;kV DC collection grid at tens of megawatts.
            I studied two promising topologies – SAB and PSFB – and focused on how well they can
            keep the input DC link voltage stable when the source and grid introduce disturbances.
            The work was entirely simulation-based (PLECS/Matlab) and compared both steady-state
            and dynamic behaviour under the same operating conditions.
          </p>

          <h2>Objectives</h2>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li>Develop a simple PI-based input DC link control for SAB and PSFB converters.</li>
            <li>Evaluate behaviour in both continuous and discontinuous conduction modes (CCM/DCM).</li>
            <li>Compare several tuning approaches: manual tuning, transfer-function-based tuning and closed-loop Ziegler–Nichols.</li>
            <li>Quantify sensitivity to disturbances in input current and output voltage for multiple converter designs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>My Contributions</h2>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li>Built averaged small-signal models of SAB and PSFB converters, including CICEA-based models for SAB/PSFB in DCM and a literature-based model for PSFB in CCM.</li>
            <li>Derived analytical transfer functions and used them to compute PI gains from Bode plots and desired crossover frequencies.</li>
            <li>Implemented manual and Ziegler–Nichols tuning loops directly in PLECS, including disturbance injection via lookup tables.</li>
            <li>Ran extensive simulations on three different converter designs and documented settling time, overshoot and robustness for each topology and tuning method.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li><strong>Converters:</strong> SAB and PSFB rated for 5&nbsp;kV ±10&nbsp;% input, 20&nbsp;kV ±10&nbsp;% output and 20&nbsp;MW, switching at 500&nbsp;Hz.</li>
            <li><strong>Control law:</strong> PI controller regulating input voltage via duty-cycle / phase-shift modulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Disturbances:</strong> ±10&nbsp;% steps on input current (renewable source) and output voltage (DC/AC stage) to emulate realistic grid events.</li>
            <li><strong>Tuning:</strong> comparison of transfer-function-based design vs. closed-loop Ziegler–Nichols and manual tuning for three sets of SAB/PSFB parameters in CCM and DCM.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Results & Insights</h2>
          <ul class="about-list">
            <li>SAB is significantly more sensitive to input-current disturbances than to output-voltage variations; PSFB shows a more balanced response.</li>
            <li>Ziegler–Nichols tuning consistently reduced input-voltage spikes compared to transfer-function-based tuning, often by more than half of the overshoot.</li>
            <li>In DCM, SAB and PSFB exhibit very similar dynamics, confirming that the same tuning approach can be reused across topologies.</li>
            <li>Carefully tuned manual PI controllers still achieved the best overall trade-off between speed and overshoot, underlining the value of engineering intuition on top of analytical tools.</li>
